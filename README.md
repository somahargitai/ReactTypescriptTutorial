# ReactTypescriptTutorial
A modern React example with Typescript, React Hooks, Styled Components, Material UI, Fontawesome



I created this tutorial to collect demos on typical problems occur in this stack, especially about Typescript, state and context. I did my best to separate examples to components, so if you want, you can simply remove components from App.tsx (or even from the component folder) to only deal with the one you need. Only exception store.tsx for context examples which is in the root folder.

For some examples I used [TechZ's tutorial video](https://youtu.be/BnIhk4igd8I). It was pretty useful
