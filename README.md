# React & Typescript Tutorial
_A modern React example with
<span style="color:#0077c6"> Typescript</span>,
<span style="color:#62dafc"> React Hooks</span>,
<span style="color:#dd6f93"> Styled Components</span>,
<span style="color:#3d80f7"> Material UI</span> and
<span style="color:#3a9f93"> Fontawesome</span>_

I created this tutorial to collect demos on typical problems occur in this stack, especially about _Typescript_, _state_ and _context_. I did my best to separate examples to components, so if you want, you can simply remove components from <code>App.tsx</code> (or even from the component folder) to only deal with the one you need.

Only exceptions are <code>store.tsx</code> for context examples which is in the root folder; and _fontawesome library_, which is defined in <code>App.tsx</code>, so its usage is simplier.

For some examples I used [TechZ's tutorial video](https://youtu.be/BnIhk4igd8I). It was pretty useful
